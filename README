Please refer to INSTALL file concerning installation instructions.

At the  moment, only Awesome  Window Manager has been  heavily tested,
but it should work properly with any Window Manager following EWMH and
ICCCM specifications.

Once you have  built the program, you can run it  by simply typing the
following command:

$ unagi

It  will look  for a  configuration file  in `$sysconfigdir/xdg/'  (by
default `/usr/local/etc/xdg/'), then fallback on XDG Base Directories,
namely   `$HOME/.config/'  then   `/etc/xdg/',  if   `XDG_CONFIG_DIRS'
environment  variable  is  not  defined (as  specified  in  `XDG  Base
Directory Specification').   You can also specified  the configuration
file by passing `-c' option.

You may  find the program  documentation in doc/ directory  in various
format (HTML, LaTeX and man pages).

You  can  also  run  it  without installing  anything  by  typing  the
following command from the source directory:

$ ./src/unagi  -r rendering/.libs/ -p plugins/.libs/ -c unagi.conf

Awesome configuration for windows opacity
=========================================

The following  sets opacity to 0.8  for URxvt (you can  use `xprop' to
find out what is the class (WM_CLASS property)):

awful.rules.rules = {
    ...
    { rule = { class = "URxvt" },
      properties = { opacity = 0.8 } },
}

Opacity depending on windows focus
----------------------------------

The following sets opacity for Emacs  and Rxvt to 0.9 when focused and
0.7  otherwise (you  can use  `xprop' to  find out  what is  the class
(WM_CLASS property)):

client.add_signal(
   "focus",
   function(c)
      if c.class:lower():find("rxvt") or c.class:lower():find("emacs") then
         c.border_color = beautiful.border_focus
         c.opacity = 0.9
      end
   end)

client.add_signal(
   "unfocus",
   function(c)
      if c.class:lower():find("rxvt") or c.class:lower():find("emacs") then
         c.border_color = beautiful.border_normal
         c.opacity = 0.7
      end
   end)

Xephyr
======

You may want to use Xephyr (nested X server) for debugging:

$ Xephyr -screen 1024x768 -ac -br :1

Then  run  the  command  given  in  the  previous  section  by  adding
DISPLAY=:1 at the beginning. You  may want to run other X applications
(such  as Awesome  window manager)  by setting  DISPLAY=:1 environment
variable before.
